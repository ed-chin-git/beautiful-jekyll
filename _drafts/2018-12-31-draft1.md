Clean water is crucial to life on this planet.  The Middle East is a region that suffers from a lack of renewable water resources. At the same time, the conflicts that began decades ago continue to this day. During this long period has the availability of clean water and arable land been affected? Let's take a closer look.
### Renewable Water Resources
The following map illustrates the world's renewable water resources per inhabitant as of 2014.

As you can see, the Middle East stands out as the area on planet with the lowest amounts of natural water resources.

### The Data
Data for this blog post was obtained from the AQUASTAT Database. It is maintained by the  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and is available [here](http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/index.html?lang=en).  AQUASTAT regroups data per 5-year period and shows for each variable the value for the most recent year during that period, if available. Detailed information on how the data is collected by the FAO is [here](http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/index.stm). 

## Percent of Population with Access to Clean Water

### Summary Statistics
After loading into pandas, here is a preliminary look at the data.

Things to point out.
There mean was never below 80% and along with minimum, has increased at every period.
On average more than 80% of the popoluation has access to clean water.


### What is the Trend?
Let's start visualizing the data.  Clearly we see a slowly improving situation.  A higher percentage of the population has access to clean water.

## A Deeper Look
Other factors have also affected the situation.

### The GDP Effect
Do high income countries fare better?

### The Drought of 2007
Beginning in 2007, the Middle East experienced the worst 3-year drought in modern-day record.  Most governments in the region were forced to impose Water restrictions and many farms lost their crops entirely.  As the drought continued the water table level fell. Farmers were forced to drill deeper. Chasing any available water left under ground. The wells finally ran dry and Syria’s farmland collapsed in an epic dust storm. In Syria, it was reported more than a million farmers joined massive shantytowns on the outskirts of Aleppo, Homs, Damascus and other cities in a futile attempt to find work and purpose.

According to the authors of a 2015 paper [“Climate Change in the Fertile Crescent and Implications of the Recent Syrian Drought,”](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3241.abstract) published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the lack of water was in large part to blame for the conflict in Syria. “The rapidly growing urban peripheries of Syria,” they wrote, “marked by illegal settlements, overcrowding, poor infrastructure, unemployment, and crime, were neglected by the Assad government and became the heart of the developing unrest.”

## Technology Brings Hope for the Future
### Developments in Desalination
In the midst of the drought Israel was running out of water. Now it has a surplus. That remarkable turnaround was accomplished through national campaigns to conserve and reuse Israel’s meager water resources, but the biggest impact came from a new wave of desalination plants.

The International Desalination Association claims that [300 million people get water from desalination](https://ensia.com/features/can-saltwater-quench-our-growing-thirst/). 

Here are some of the latest developments

### The opportunity for water diplomacy
Israel supplies the West Bank with water, as required by the 1995 Oslo II Accords, but the Palestinians still receive far less than they need. Water has been entangled with other negotiations in the ill-fated peace process, but now that more is at hand, many observers see the opportunity to depoliticize it. Bar-Zeev has ambitious plans for a Water Knows No Boundaries conference in 2018, which will bring together water scientists from Egypt, Turkey, Jordan, Israel, the West Bank and Gaza for a meeting of the minds.
