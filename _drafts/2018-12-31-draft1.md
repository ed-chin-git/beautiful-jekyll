Clean water is crucial to life on this planet.  The Middle East is a region that suffers from a lack of natural water resources. At the same time, the conflicts that began decades ago continue to this day. During this long period has the availability of clean water and arable land been affected? Let's take a closer look.
### Renewable Water Resources
The following map illustrates the situation.  It clearly points out the lack of renewable water sources in the region.

### The Data
Data for this blog post was obtained from the AQUASTAT Database. It is maintained by the  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and is available [here](http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/index.html?lang=en).  AQUASTAT regroups data per 5-year period and shows for each variable the value for the most recent year during that period, if available. Detailed information on how the data is collected by the FAO is [here](http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/index.stm). 

## Access to Clean Water
### Summary Statistics
After loading into pandas, here is a preliminary look at the data.

### What is the Trend?
Let's start visualizing the data.  Clearly the data shows an improving situation despite our pre-conceptions.  A higher percentage of the population has access to clean water.

## A Deeper Look

### The GDP Effect
Do high income countries fare better?

### The Syrian Drought of 2007
Beginning in 2007, Syria and the greater Fertile Crescent (FC), experienced the worst 3-year drought in modern-day record.  Water restrictions were imposed, and many farmers lost a year’s crops. As the drought intensified and the water table plunged, Syria’s farmers chased it, drilling wells 100, 200, then 500 meters (300, 700, then 1,600 feet) down in a literal race to the bottom. Eventually, the wells ran dry and Syria’s farmland collapsed in an epic dust storm. More than a million farmers joined massive shantytowns on the outskirts of Aleppo, Homs, Damascus and other cities in a futile attempt to find work and purpose.

And that, according to the authors of [“Climate Change in the Fertile Crescent and Implications of the Recent Syrian Drought,”](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3241.abstract) a 2015 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was the tinder that burned Syria to the ground. “The rapidly growing urban peripheries of Syria,” they wrote, “marked by illegal settlements, overcrowding, poor infrastructure, unemployment, and crime, were neglected by the Assad government and became the heart of the developing unrest.”

## Technology Brings Hope for the Future
### Developments in Desalination
Just a few years ago, in the depths of its worst drought in at least 900 years, Israel was running out of water. Now it has a surplus. That remarkable turnaround was accomplished through national campaigns to conserve and reuse Israel’s meager water resources, but the biggest impact came from a new wave of desalination plants.

The International Desalination Association claims that [300 million people get water from desalination](https://ensia.com/features/can-saltwater-quench-our-growing-thirst/). 

Here are some of the latest developments

### The opportunity for water diplomacy
Israel supplies the West Bank with water, as required by the 1995 Oslo II Accords, but the Palestinians still receive far less than they need. Water has been entangled with other negotiations in the ill-fated peace process, but now that more is at hand, many observers see the opportunity to depoliticize it. Bar-Zeev has ambitious plans for a Water Knows No Boundaries conference in 2018, which will bring together water scientists from Egypt, Turkey, Jordan, Israel, the West Bank and Gaza for a meeting of the minds.
