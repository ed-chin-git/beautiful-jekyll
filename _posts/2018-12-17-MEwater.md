Clean water is crucial to life on this planet.  The Middle East is a region that suffers from a lack of natural water resources. At the same time, the conflicts that began decades ago continue to this day. During this long period has the availability of clean water and arable land been affected? Let's take a closer look at the data.

### Data Source
Data for this study was obtained from the AQUASTAT Database maintained by the  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Available [here](http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/index.html?lang=en).
