Clean water is crucial to life on this planet.  The Middle East is a region that suffers from a lack of natural water resources. At the same time, the conflicts that began decades ago continue to this day. During this long period has the availability of clean water and arable land been affected? Let's take a closer look at the data.

### Data Source
Data for this blog post was obtained from the AQUASTAT Database. It is maintained by the  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and is available [here](http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/index.html?lang=en).  AQUASTAT regroups data per 5-year period and shows for each variable the value for the most recent year during that period, if available. Detailed information on how the data is collected by the FAO is [here](http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/index.stm). 
### Renewable Water Resources
The following map illustrates the situation.  The Middle East region has very few renewable water sources.

### What is the Trend?
Let's start visualizing the data.  Clearly the data shows an improving situation despite our pre-conceptions.  A higher percentage of the population has access to clean water.

## Hope for the Future
### Desalination Technology
The International Desalination Association claims that [300 million people get water from desalination](https://ensia.com/features/can-saltwater-quench-our-growing-thirst/).
